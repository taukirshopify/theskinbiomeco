As a result, I get very conscious of the way I look and will always wear a mask or apply (heavy) make up before I leave my home.<\/p>\n                            <p class=\"testi-card_text\">Thanks to The SkinBiome Co.â€™s Derma Relief Cream, I can now restore my skin health without worrying about the side effects from steroids! I am super happy to have found a cream that provides lasting effect, making me confident in my skin appearance again!<\/p>",
