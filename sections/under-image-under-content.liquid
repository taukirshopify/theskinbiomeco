            <p class="fs-30 mb-30">Through his research, Dr Pennino discovered Dermafixium, which is a beneficial
                extract from one of the good microbes on the healthy skin of children and adults and is deficient in
                individuals affected by skin disorders like Eczema. Importantly, this microbial strain of Lactobacillus
                behind Dermafixium lives specifically on human skin, unlike the other members in the same family that
                are normally found in the gut.</p>

            <p class="mt-20 fs-30 mb-0">Dermafixium is a natural source of essential molecules and nutrients for the
                skin, consisting of short-chain fatty acids and microbial metabolites, that promote healthier skin when
                re-introduced onto the skin. Dr Pennino and The SkinBiome Co. team spent close to 10 years developing a
                highly effective formula for people affected by skin disorders. Our scientific data here strongly
                supports that our formulation can lead to visible skin improvement within one day of application.</p>
