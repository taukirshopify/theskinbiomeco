As a result, I get very conscious of the way I look and will always wear a mask or apply (heavy) make up before I leave my home.<\/p>\n                            <p class=\"testi-card_text\">Thanks to The SkinBiome Co.â€™s Derma Relief Cream, I can now restore my skin health without worrying about the side effects from steroids! I am super happy to have found a cream that provides lasting effect, making me confident in my skin appearance again!<\/p>",

Just taking a shower or washing my face would cause painful stinging, and sometimes I would wake up at night with pain, which is very disruptive to my sleep. I hadn't found a good product until The SkinBiome Co.'s Derma Relief Cream.<\/p>\n                            <p class=\"testi-card_text\">This product quickly soothes and relieves the discomfort around my eye within a day of application, and it's easy to consistently apply.<\/p>",
